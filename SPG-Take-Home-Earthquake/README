Overview

As I stated to the recuiters due to my recent injury (which I cannot put any weight on my left food) earlier this week, I had to move my onsites and shift them later, however, it was relayed to me that there wasn't any way I could push this to give me more time given a full interview day yesterday and today.I considered switching it to a normal techinal, which in retrospect, would've been better. If you all feel that would be a good idea, I woudl be happy to do that today instead.

That being said, I only really was able to get maybe an hour in as everything when you can't walk takes 4x the time. I truly apologize, but I will do my best to outline the main portions and fundamentals I would use to build such a thing.
