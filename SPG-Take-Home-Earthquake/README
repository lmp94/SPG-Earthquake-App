Overview

As I stated to the recruiter due to my recent injury (which I cannot put any weight on my left foot) earlier this week, I had to move my on-site's and shift them later, however, it was relayed to me that there wasn't any way I could push this to give me more time given a full interview day yesterday and today.

***In retrospect, I should've requested a normal technical interview earlier this week instead to better pivot given the new time constraints. If you would like to do that today, please feel free.***

Regardless, I will continue to work on this until our time, as well on the weekend as I really like creating things and following things through.

That being said, I only really was able to get maybe an hour in as everything when you can't walk takes 4x the time. I truly apologize, but I will do my best to outline the main portions and fundamentals I would use to build such a thing.
